- **Copyright**: (C) 2024 Michael Maltsev
- **License**: GNU General Public License v3.0
- **Repository**: https://github.com/michael-maltsev/technion-sap-info-fetcher
- **Purpose**: A script to fetch and parse Technion SAP courses information in accessible JSON format
- **Original Features**: 
  - SAP API integration for Technion course data
  - Course schedule parsing and formatting
  - Building name mapping and room information
  - Exam date extraction and formatting
  - Prerequisite and course relationship parsing
  - Caching system for API responses

### Relationship to Original Work
This project extends and enhances the original technion-sap-info-fetcher while maintaining full compatibility with its core functionality. The original parsing logic, API endpoints, and data structures serve as the foundation for all enhancements made in this version.

- University-specific collection structure
- Automatic metadata management
- Batch upload optimization for large datasets

#### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Improvements**
- Restructured as object-oriented class-based architecture
- `TechnionCourseFetcher` base class with extensible design
- `NoCacheTechnionCourseFetcher` for real-time data fetching
- Modular design supporting multiple universities
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms

#### ü§ñ **Smart Automation**
- Automatic current semester detection based on date
- Next semester prediction and pre-fetching
- University metadata setup and management
- Intelligent batch processing with progress tracking
- Configurable update frequency and scheduling

#### üìä **Data Management**
- Enhanced course data validation
- Improved schedule conflict detection
- Extended metadata fields for course tracking
- Better handling of Hebrew text and encoding
- Structured university information storage

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Experience**
- Comprehensive command-line interface
- Verbose logging and debugging options
- Smart caching controls (cache/no-cache modes)
- Better error messages and troubleshooting
- Improved documentation and code comments

#### üöÄ **Performance & Reliability**
- Optimized API request handling
- Better timeout and retry mechanisms
- Memory-efficient batch processing
- Reduced API load through intelligent caching
- Enhanced data consistency checks

### Technical Contributions
- **New Dependencies**: firebase-admin, enhanced dataclass usage
- **Configuration System**: Firebase service account integration
- **Data Models**: CourseInfo dataclass with extended fields
- **CLI Enhancements**: Advanced argument parsing and validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management
- **Logging**: Structured logging with multiple verbosity levels

### Compatibility
This enhanced version maintains full backward compatibility with the original project's:
- JSON output format
- Command-line interface patterns  
- Core data structures and field names
- API interaction methods

### Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Michael Maltsev for creating the original technion-sap-info-fetcher and making it available under GPL-3.0. This project builds upon their excellent foundation work in reverse-engineering the Technion SAP API and creating robust parsing algorithms.

The original project's comprehensive approach to handling Hebrew text, complex schedule parsing, and SAP API quirks provided an invaluable starting point for these enhancements.
